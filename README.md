# Youtube-Video-Downloader
This project is built using "pytube". With a given youtube video-url/playlist-url, the video(s) will be downloaded to a specific directory mentioned by the user.

## Dependencies

1. pip install pytube3
2. [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

## Important Note

pytube only allows downloads in mp4 format and not in mp3 format. So to convert mp4 to mp3, FFMPEG is required and so has to be added to **path** manually.
